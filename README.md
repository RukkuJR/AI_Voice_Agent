# AI_Voice_Agent

I was exploring all the key use cases of AI voice agents and thats where found potentiality on FAQ/appoointment agents for dental clinics. Hence quickly developed an ideation how it could look like in AWS partyrock and Replitt.

To make it formal, I decided to create a prototype if this is feasibe or not. After brief Research, I decided to go ahead on below tools to experiment.
below is the diagram.

The flow would be, when a patient calls a dental clinic, that number will be forwarded to a virtual number created via twilio for malaysia. The call is routed from US to malaysia since twilio servers were in US. Than via SIP trunk the call is connected virtually to internet specifically on RetellAI. RetellAI is AI voice agents that can engage in natural, human-like phone conversations(NO CODE). Itâ€™s often used for automating inbound or outbound calls. Here all the taks related to AI agent naturally written. So when the patients asks question, it uses chatgpt 4.0 mini to do reasoning and get back to eleven-labs to translate into prefered voice. So the key is to book appointment via Cal.com which is connected to google calender. Cal.com is used since it can scale to other calenders too. Than once the booking is made, the patient details, phone number, conversation, is organized and put into google sheet automatically. This automation is done via make.com where there is webhook constantly listening in RetellAI and feed into google sheet. Later Doctor's could audit this Google Sheets. On othe side, I have fed with Clinic's FAQ's like opening hours, doctors in call, cost etc as knowledge for the llm to use and rsepond to patients' query. Once all done it will send close and wrap up call with the patient who is in the line.

All the blueprints available in json format which can be imported into retell ai. However its not easy just to plug and play where all the tweaks to be done.

Key challenges faced while building the prototype:

1: For malaysia land line number provided by twilio is routed from the us servers, hence there is unavoidable latency in internet calls. But Situation will improve over time as more data centers being built in malaysia.

2: Realtime AI Gpt is not perfect as too many glitches here in there from the GPT, again situtaion will improve as NVIDIA is builiding more porwerful GPU's for LLM's. Hence for now i had to hold email appointments since it has to spell chekcing or 1 by 1 eg a for apple , b for boy etc which don't synch with the complete AI rythm.

3: Local Malaysian language support so far was from eleven labs with only 1 custom voice called affifah -voice id - UcqZLa941Kkt8ZhEEybf. However in malaysia we used to mix up malay & english in our conversation. So I believe multilingual support is must have for a malaysian market.

4: Cost on the Retell AI is a bit on the costly end whre I could only experiment  around 20 mins of time which could wipe out 10usd - RM 44 quickly. So if I use more realtime gpt like gpt4o realtime, it far costlier. Again over time this will definitly go down as more will start to use. There is another cheaper alternative is to use n8n no code platform to implelment this for MVP instead.
